# Distillation Landing Log

This log records structural landings for the `aoa-techniques` Distillation
mechanic.

## 2026-05-01 - Active parts split

Changed:

- added route-local `AGENTS.md`, `DIRECTION.md`, `PARTS.md`, `PROVENANCE.md`,
  `LANDING_LOG.md`, and `ROADMAP.md`
- moved the five formerly flat distillation docs into part-local active homes
- added `parts/` and `legacy/` route cards
- preserved candidate verdicts and ledger counts without compaction
- added a decision record for the active/parts/legacy split

Verification lane:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_distillation_mechanics_topology
python scripts/validate_repo.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Not moved:

- no raw donor wave packet was copied into `legacy/raw/`
- no candidate verdict was promoted, dropped, or rewritten
- no technique bundle was minted by this structural pass

## 2026-05-01 - External candidate ledger source-status pass

Changed:

- preserved the active external candidate ledger as
  [legacy/raw/EXTERNAL_CANDIDATE_LEDGER_2026-05-01_PRE_PRUNE.md](legacy/raw/EXTERNAL_CANDIDATE_LEDGER_2026-05-01_PRE_PRUNE.md)
- marked `seed_4.txt` and `seed_6.txt` as historical source labels whose raw
  files are not present in the current checkout
- kept candidate verdicts, counts, and narrowing-lane posture unchanged

Verification lane:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_distillation_mechanics_topology
python scripts/validate_repo.py
```

## 2026-05-01 - External candidate ledger compaction

Changed:

- compacted the active external candidate ledger into route, source-status,
  summary, candidate-accounting, landed-anchor, and reopen-rule sections
- kept the detailed wave execution notes and donor-read details in the preserved
  pre-prune receipt
- kept candidate verdicts, counts, and the `phase_sync_for_agents` narrowing
  lane unchanged

Verification lane:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_distillation_mechanics_topology
python scripts/validate_repo.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## 2026-05-01 - External candidate registry

Changed:

- added a part-local seed registry, schemas, example, builder, validator, tests,
  and generated compact index for
  [parts/external-candidate-ledger](parts/external-candidate-ledger/README.md)
- kept all `13` candidate verdicts, status counts, and the
  `phase_sync_for_agents` active narrowing lane unchanged
- made atom/topology and law/local/bridge gates explicit per candidate without
  promoting any candidate into a technique bundle

Verification lane:

```bash
python mechanics/distillation/parts/external-candidate-ledger/scripts/build_external_candidate_registry.py --check
python mechanics/distillation/parts/external-candidate-ledger/scripts/validate_external_candidate_registry.py
python -m pytest -q mechanics/distillation/parts/external-candidate-ledger/tests/test_external_candidate_registry.py
python -m unittest tests.test_distillation_mechanics_topology
python scripts/validate_repo.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Not moved:

- no external candidate was promoted, dropped, or reclassified
- no raw donor source was treated as present when it was only a historical label
- no generated index became authority over the active part README or bundle
  review path
